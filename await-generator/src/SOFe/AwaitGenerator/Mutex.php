/**
 * A mutex is a lock that can only be acquired by one coroutine at a time.
 * Coroutines can acquire the lock by calling `acquire()`, and release it by calling `release()`.
 * `acquire()` is an asynchronous operation, which suspends until other coroutines release the lock.
 * If multiple coroutines request the same lock,
 * the first coroutine requesting the lock acquires it first.
 * A mutex can be thought as a run queue.
 *
 * To avoid forgetting to release the lock,
 * use the `run`/`runClosure` methods,
 * which executes the given generator only when the lock is acquired,
 * and automatically releases the lock when the generator completes (even if it throws an exception).
 *
 * Since it is impossible to identify which coroutine is running,
 * recursive mutex locking will lead to deadlock.
